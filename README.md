# OrangeJuice

A custom fork of Minecraft proxy Velocity which is aimed to improve overall experience of players' with poor connections.

## Goals
 - Re-routing connections of players who have high latency values using configurable proxies,
 - Compress packets even more before sending them to the client,
 - Geolocation based proxy routing to further reduce ping of foreign players,
 - Reduce the network usage of AFK players.

Currently being used in 2 Turkish Networks exclusively with minimal results as most of our features are yet to be implemented.
Requires heavy configuration and a little bit more CPU power when compared to vanilla Velocity.
